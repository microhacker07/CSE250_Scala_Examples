# CSE250 Scala Examples

This was made to potentially be easier to download/manage than copy and paste from the website.
The folder ScalaSamples contains all the examples that are found on Dr. Kenneth W. Regan's website
(
    [main page](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/cse250/),
    [scala samples](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/cse250/ScalaSamples/)
)
